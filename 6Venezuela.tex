\section{Venezuela}

In Venezuela, some fans still subsist, but there are only 4 astronomers in exercise, 3 women, 1 man, 1 of the women is retired and the other 3 without resources to continue working in the country and considering emigrating. Students have 2 masters left at the moment doing theses linked in some way to CIDA (both tutorsed by former CIDA researchers, one in Uruguay and the other in Mexico). Of rest, I am not aware of any other thesis in astronomy / astrophysics of any university that is being carried out in Venezuela.

\section{Introduction}

The countries in the Andean Region (Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,Peru and Venezuela) represent a common language block in South America.
 
Historically they have also made part of common trading blogs (Andean Community, Comunidad Andina (CAN) in Spanish).
They share similar social conditions and goals for scientific and cultural development.
\\

The astronomical development in each of these countries can be efficiently achieved through regional cooperation. With the leadership of Chile in aspects of professional astronomy and Colombia for public outreach, it is possible to develop strategies to strengthen the professional research, education and popularization of astronomy in the Andean region.
\\

This development effort requires the commitment and shared effort from different institutions.
\\

An Andean Regional Office of Astronomy for Development (ROAD) can serve this goal. It will strengthen ongoing collaboration efforts, create channels of communication and develop new strategies to exchange knowledge and human resources in the region. 
\\

The participating institutions have been involved in different projects in each one of the ROAD core areas: research, schools and children and public. However, the participation and degree of commitment has not been homogeneous across the region, or even inside the same country.
\\

Therefore our main goal is to guarantee and strengthen effective methods of communication between the representatives and coordinators of global, regional and local projects implemented in the Andean countries, specially looking to orient and advise new working groups
in other cities and regions. This lead us to define the following objectives.

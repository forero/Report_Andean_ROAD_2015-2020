\subsection{Andean School on Astronomy and Astrophysics}
\textbf{Objective} Organize a school for advanced undergraduate
students and graduate students.  
\\
\textbf{Lead:} Changes every year. 
\\
\textbf{Planned Implementation:} 
Every year we will hold a school aimed at advanced undergraduate
students and graduate students.  
The main subjects of the school have to be broad enough allowing a
large student participation.  
This venue will also serve as a upstanding scenario to invite tutors
from abroad and strengthen new institutional collaborations with the
Andean ROAD.  
The first school will take place in 2014 hosted in Ecuador close to
the dates for the Colombian Congress of Astronomy and Astrophysics. 

\subsubsection{Results}

We managed to organize three schools in Quito (2014), Bogot\'a (2015)
and Lima (2018).  

The first school in Quito (2014) was lead by Prof. Nicol\'as V\'asquez
at the Escuela Polit\'ecnica Nacional.  
The school had [XX] students from [COUNTRIES] and [XX] instructors
from [COUNTRIES].  
The dates of the school were [XXX] and the main teaching subjects were [XXX].

The second school took place in Bogota (June 1 through June 26, 2015). 
It was lead by Prof. Jaime E. Forero-Romero at Universidad de los
Andes (\url{http://forero.github.io/AndeanCosmologySchool/}). 
The school had 18  students from Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,
Peru and Venezuela.
It had four instructors working in Germany (Potsdam Astrophysical Institute), 
Israel (Hebrew University) and the United States (Caltech and Berkeley Lab)
The main subject was cosmology in four aspects: theory, simulations,
experiment and intrumentation. 

The third school was held in Lima (November 12-16, 2018) 
It took place within the third workshop \emph{Astronom\'ia en los Andes}. 
It was lead by Prof. Maria Isela Zevallos from the Universidad
Nacional de Ingenier\'ia. The schoold had [XX] students from
[COUNTRIES] and [XX] instructors   
The school had the following courses

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Milky Way Structure and Evolution. Dr. Dante Minniti Universidad Andrés Bello (UNAB, Chile).
    \item "Astronomical Techniques in Planetary Sciences". Dr. Gonzalo Tancredi (University of Uruguay, Uruguay).
    \item "Astronomy in the School". Dr. Paulo Sergio Bretones (UFSC, Brazil).
\end{enumerate}

For this school the biggest challenge was to get participation from
researchers, amateurs and students from all the Andean ROAD
countries. No participants came from Bolivia, nor from Chile.  
The most numerous participation was that of university students
followed by that of the fans and, finally, the professors. 
The scientific community in Astronomy in Peru is small, but most of
them attended.   



The biggest challenge for all schools was to secure stable funding.
 The first school relied entirely on local funding.
The second school the central OAD office sponsored the
accommodation for the 15 students from Ecuador, Venezuela, 
Bolivia and Chile, which represented close to $20\%$ of the total expenses.
For the third school the Andean ROAD sponsored the accommodation for
10 students from  Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Peru,
which represented close to $10\%$ of the total expenses. 

Putting together every school required a large effort from the Local
Organizing Committee to secure the funding from local organizations.
This instability made it difficult for us to continue with the desired
annual periodicity.

%On behalf of CIDA in Mérida, Venezuela, it was agreed to play a support and support role within TF1, for the tasks of the ASAA. 
%What was then offered to Andean ROAD was his experience of several years in the realization of astronomy schools within Venezuela, some of these were attended by Colombian students, and also offered the possibility of teaching some online postgraduate courses, because they had the human capital and the technical possibilities (internet) of doing so. 
%In those first meetings of the Node held in Bogotá, it was seen that the conditions of professional astronomy in Venezuela were deteriorating and several years later, that prediction has been coming true. 
%Currently, there are only four professional astronomers left in practice, and although the community in Venezuela was never very large, it was up to 4 times the current number. 
%The forecasts for next year are that one of the 4 professionals retire and the remaining 3 migrate. 
%Currently, Venezuela as a country, is not in a position to offer something concrete, however, some Venezuelan astronomers, individually, in other countries of the region, will be able to continue supporting the tasks of the TF1 of the Andean ROAD, from their respective countries of residence.

%The National Polytechnic School of Ecuador participated in the organization of the First Andean School of Astronomy and Astrophysics. (Quito, December 2014, Organizer: Nicolás Vásquez) and the Second Andean School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
